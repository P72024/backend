Thank you Mr President. March European Council confirmed the EU role as a promoter of the highest nuclear safety standards worldwide and in the EU neighbourhood.
At least two new nuclear projects at the EU external border raise serious concern, due to lack of transparency and consultation with countries affected.
New NPPs containing experimental reactors will be located in the Kaliningrad enclave in between two Member States and only 23 kilometres away from the eastern EU border in Belarus.
The EU in cooperation with the relevant international bodies, should see that the developers would comply with the highest nuclear safety and environmental standards already at the beginning of the development stage.
And would allow international nuclear experts to assess both projects, especially site selection criteria.
The EU could effectively prevent unsafe nuclear development by refusing to contract energy to be produced in unclean nuclear power plant stations.
What role does the European Commission see in preventing unsafe nuclear development at the external EU border? What measures it could take?
